\chapter*{Summary}
Environment's parameters measurements are omnipresent in our lives. 
From everyday life to heavy industries and even research they are widely used in many 
processes. Considering that there is a place for a system that would
automate many actions taken in their workflow. For example the
process of taking measurments and storing them or accessing historical
data. The goal of this thesis is to create a system that could
resolve many of those problems and allow for further extension.
The following chapters will compare the proposed solution to other
already available solutions in many aspects e.g. their price and
complexity. Further chapters will be spent on disscussing chosen
technologies used in implementation and the implementation itself and
its details. The conclusion will contain information on how well
the system fits its role and further possible improvements that could be made.
